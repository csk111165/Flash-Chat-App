# Errors

* body1 doesnot exists now, need to use bodyMedium or other subsequent things 
* FlatButton is deprecated use TextButton

# Notes

* copyWith copies the property but allows the other attrib to get modified too, like here hinttext
* this would allow us to use the same componemtn with slightly varying property.
